# Miscellaneous Utilities

## Interaction System (`Move By Event/`)
- **`InteractionTrigger.cs`**: A generic trigger system that fires UnityEvents when the player enters or interacts. Often used with `E_InteractionTrigger` for custom editor visualization.
- **`TransformStateTweener.cs`**: A utility for smoothly moving objects between predefined states (likely using DOTween or manual interpolation).

## Animation & VFX
- **`Cat Animator/Animator.cs`**: Specialized animator controller logic, likely for a specific character or entity type.
- **`VFX/A_Blast.cs`**: Logic for spawning or controlling blast-related visual effects.

## Editor Tools (`Editor/`)
- **`E_Base.cs`**: Custom editor base for entities.
- **`E_InteractionTrigger.cs`**: Custom inspector for the interaction system to make it easier to set up triggers in the Unity Editor.
